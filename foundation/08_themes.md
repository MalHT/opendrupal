## Intro

Drupal comes with a very ‘Drupally’ look out of the box, so if you want to give it a bit more of a unique look you can change the Theme. A theme in Drupal controls how the website looks, all of the content and the back-end settings of the website remains the same when you change your theme. There are some settings which you can change per-theme, such as the logo.
